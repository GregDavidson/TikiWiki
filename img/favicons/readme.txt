Tiki has favicon support for modern Apple, Android & Windows integration.

To disable the feature, simply delete the contents of img/favicons & the favicon.ico in the root folder.

To generate custom favicons and the supporting xml & jason files, visit http://realfavicongenerator.net.

You may choose to use some or all of the favicons, but customized files must match the existing file name(s) exactly, including the extension.
